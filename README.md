# BayesianNetwork

# Overview
A Bayesian Network is a type of probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

The network can be used to make inferences about the relationships between the variables, and can be used for a variety of tasks, including prediction, classification, and decision-making.

# Example
Here's an example of a Bayesian Network:

Bayesian Network Example

The network is made up of four variables: "Burglary", "Earthquake", "Alarm", and "JohnCalls". The relationships between these variables are as follows:

Burglary: This variable represents whether or not a burglary is currently taking place. The probability of a burglary occurring is represented by the variable's prior probability, P(B).
Earthquake: This variable represents whether or not an earthquake is currently taking place. The probability of an earthquake occurring is also represented by the variable's prior probability, P(E).
Alarm: This variable represents whether or not the alarm system has been triggered. The probability of the alarm being triggered given a burglary or an earthquake is represented by the conditional probabilities, P(A|B) and P(A|E), respectively.
JohnCalls: This variable represents whether or not John has called to report the alarm. The probability of John calling given that the alarm has been triggered is represented by the conditional probability, P(J|A).
Using this network, we can make inferences about the probabilities of various events based on the available evidence. For example, if we observe that the alarm has been triggered, we can use the network to calculate the probability of a burglary or an earthquake occurring.

Overall, the Mari John Bayesian Network is a useful example of how Bayesian Networks can be used to model complex systems and make inferences based on available evidence.

# Usage
To use a Bayesian Network, you will typically need to:

Define the variables and their conditional dependencies in the form of a DAG.
Specify the parameters of the network, including the conditional probabilities for each variable given its parents.
Use the network to make inferences about the relationships between the variables.


# Conclusion
Bayesian Networks are a powerful tool for modeling and reasoning under uncertainty. They can be used for a wide range of tasks, and are particularly useful in domains such as healthcare, finance, and engineering.
